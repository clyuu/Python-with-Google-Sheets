# Python-with-Google-Sheets
I'll guide you on how to write Python code to interact with Google Sheets, including all necessary actions such as reading, writing, updating, and deleting data. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive example, which includes setting up authentication, opening a Google Sheet, and performing various operations.

Prerequisites:

1.Install Required Libraries:
   	
    "pip install gspread oauth2client"


2.Enable Google Sheets and Google Drive APIs:
     	
*Go to the Google Cloud Console.

*Create a new project or select an existing one.

*Enable the Google Sheets API and Google Drive API.

*Create a service account and download the JSON credentials file.






3.Share the Google Sheet:

*Share the Google Sheet with the service account email found in the JSON credentials file.





Running the Script:


1.Save the script as "main.py".

2.Ensure sheet.json is in the same directory.

3.Run the script using Python:

	"python main.py"



This script demonstrates reading data, writing a new row, updating a cell, and deleting a row in a Google Sheet. Adjust the row and column indices as needed based on your specific Google Sheet structure.
